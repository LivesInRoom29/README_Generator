## Description
This project is a command-line application that automatically generates a professional README file. The user simply answers some questions, and the data obtained from the answers is used to populate a README template.

The **technology** used to create this project:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```
npm install
```


## Usage
Once installed, from the terminal (*and from within the same directory as the index.js file*), run the program with the command:

```
node index
```

Answer the questions as prompted. Be sure to follow the directions on the screen. For some of the questions, a default text editor will open for you to use to type your response. Save this temporary file and close it for the data to be saved by the program.

Once all questions are answered, the README file will be generated in an output folder.

For a detailed video of how to use the application, see the [instructional video](https://youtu.be/jvTIij2qmPA).
